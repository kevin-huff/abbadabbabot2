# TODO ðŸš§

Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try editing the code.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's add the wiggle function to other elements in the siteâ€“you'll see comments in the code with `TODO` in them for each step.

In `pages/about.jsx`, add the imports at the top:

```js
import { useWiggle } from "../hooks/wiggle";
import { animated } from "react-spring";
```

Bring the wiggle style and trigger function in before the `return` statement, this time with slightly different parameters:

```js
const [style, trigger] = useWiggle({ x: 50, rotation: 1, scale: 1.2 });
```

Replace the header element to use `animated` and apply the wiggle style:

```js
<animated.h1 className="title" style={style}>
 About this site
</animated.h1>
```

Let's make the effect happen when the user hovers over the first paragraph element by replacing its opening tag:

```js
<p onMouseEnter={trigger}>
```

Hover over the paragraph to see the effect on the About page header!

## Keep going! ðŸš€

Try experimenting with the `useWiggle` properties for different effects!
=======
Let's keep track of the submitted favorites using an array. First add this code near the top of `server.js` (where the comment says `ADD FAVORITES ARRAY VARIABLE`):

```js
const favorites = [];
```

In the `POST` route, inside the `if(color)` block, add this code to save the submitted value to the array, and write it to the console:

```js
favorites.push(color);
console.log(favorites);
```

Click __Tools__ > __Logs__ at the bottom of Glitch to see the log statement in action when you submit new colors through the form.

## Keep going! ðŸš€

Clearly this is not a robust data storage approach and won't persist for long! Your Node apps can use a variety of databases, like [SQLite](https://glitch.com/~glitch-hello-sqlite) and [Airtable](https://glitch.com/~glitch-hello-airtable).
